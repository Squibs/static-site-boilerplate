# Boilerplate for Static Websites

- Webpack 4
- Sass
- Bootstrap 4
  - jQuery
  - Popper
- Babel
- Eslint (Airbnb eslintrc)
- FontAwesome

A boilerplate for static websites I created while learning Webpack. Trying to learn Webpack, just as Webpack 4 is barely out the gate, proved to be a bit of a struggle; but hopefully what I have learned in creating this so far is correct for Webpack 4.
