        <p>
          First and foremost, the purpose of building this <em>Static Site Boilerplate</em>, was to learn how to use WebPack.
          While learning WebPack, I figured I should build something fairly simple, and that I could potentially end up using in the future.
          Thus, the <em>Static Site Boilerplate</em> was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of creating this; WebPack 4 was just barely released, and I had no knowledge of using any form of task runner
          ( <i class="fab fa-gulp"></i> Gulp &amp; <i class="fab fa-grunt"></i> Grunt ), build tool/system, or module bundler. There was not a huge
          amount of documentation for WebPack 4 either. The use of the webpack.js.org <code>next</code> branch, the few WebPack 4 tutorials available
          at the time, previous version documentation and WebPack 2 &amp; 3 tutorials were all I had to go on while creating this boilerplate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe one of the more popular uses of WebPack is for dynamic web pages, mainly React. I wanted to create something for static websites that
          may have several pages rather than a single dynamic page or app.
